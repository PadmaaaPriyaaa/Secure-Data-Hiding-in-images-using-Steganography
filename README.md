# Secure-Data-Hiding-in-images-using-Steganography

Project Title : Secure Data Hiding in images using Steganography

Problem Statement : 

 This project successfully embeds encrypted data in images using steganography, ensuring security, visual integrity, and resistance to detection. By leveraging OpenCV, OS, and string manipulation, it optimizes data capacity while preserving image quality. Advanced techniques like AES encryption and adaptive LSB enhance security. The solution is practical for confidential communication and cybersecurity, with potential for extensions like video steganography and AI-based detection prevention.
 
Technology used :

 Python 3.9 – Programming Language
 
 OpenCV – Used for image processing, reading, writing images
 
 OS Module – Handles file system operations
 
 String Module – For Character processing and generating text-based keys
 
 Cryptography Library – For encrypting the hidden data before embedding it
 
Wow Factors :

 Advanced Security Features
 
 Multiple File Support
 
 Improved Steganography Techniques
 
 Multi-Image Encoding
 
 Two Layers of Security
 
Conclusion :

 This project successfully embeds encrypted data in images using steganography, ensuring security, visual integrity, and resistance to detection. By leveraging OpenCV, OS, and string manipulation, it optimizes data capacity while preserving image quality. Advanced techniques like AES encryption and adaptive LSB enhance security. The solution is practical for confidential communication and cybersecurity, with potential for extensions like video steganography and AI-based detection prevention.
